Data mesh is a new approach to handling large amounts of data at scale within an organization. This session focuses on the application code of a data product that ingests data via its input port, processes it and produces output at its output port. <br/><br/> [Video Recording](VIDEO_LINK)<br/><br/> -Samia Rahman and Alpesh Pandya, _Thoughtworks_ |
